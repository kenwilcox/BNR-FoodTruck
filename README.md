=============

Earlier this year I took a class from Big Nerd Ranch [Cross-Platform JavaScript Apps with HTML5](https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/cross-platform-javascript-apps-with-html5) by [Chris Aquino](https://twitter.com/radishmouse)

Absolutely loved it, but I was so busy trying to keep up drinking from the firehose I didn't even think about using git for the things I was doing.

I'm not just going back and re-doing everything. This is the start of that.
